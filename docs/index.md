## Introduction

VtopScrapper is an API to VIT-AP's Student portal which enables you to build applications using the data provided by the portal

This is a 3rd party API (unofficial) so the service does not have direct access to the database instead it's consists of scrapping scripts in the backend (making it a little slower )<a name="usage"></a>

## Usage

**Package** If the user intends to use it in a python application then he/she may directly install the package from Pypi(like most python packages)

    pip install vtopscrapper

**Web API** If an app you intend to build restricts you from using python (like android app in which case you most likely are to use JAVA) in that case you can make http requests to the API

**Note** : Project is expected to make progress towards providing the services on maximum possible languages in near future eliminating the need of using it over web (Instead just downloading the package) but for now it is only available in python.
